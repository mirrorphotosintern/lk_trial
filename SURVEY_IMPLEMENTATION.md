# Survey System Implementation

## Overview

I've implemented a comprehensive 3-step survey system for the LearnKannada app that collects user preferences, goals, and learning profiles during the onboarding process. The survey is designed to personalize the learning experience and gather valuable user insights.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (`db/schema/survey-schema.ts`)
- **Complete survey data model** with all required fields
- **PostgreSQL enums** for structured data (goals, time horizons, age bands, etc.)
- **Step tracking** to allow users to resume incomplete surveys
- **Timestamps** for creation and updates

### 2. Server Actions (`actions/db/survey-actions.ts`)
- **CRUD operations** for survey responses
- **Step-by-step updates** to save progress incrementally
- **Survey completion tracking**
- **Error handling** with ActionState pattern

### 3. TypeScript Types (`types/survey-types.ts`)
- **Step-specific interfaces** for type safety
- **Form data validation** types
- **Progress tracking** interfaces
- **Constants** for dropdown options (languages, time preferences)

### 4. UI Components

#### Main Survey Page (`app/(auth)/survey/page.tsx`)
- **Server-side authentication** check
- **Existing data loading** for survey resumption
- **Suspense boundaries** for loading states

#### Survey Container (`app/(auth)/survey/_components/survey-container.tsx`)
- **Multi-step navigation** with progress tracking
- **Form validation** for each step
- **Data persistence** on each step completion
- **Loading states** and error handling
- **Automatic redirect** on completion

#### Step Components
- **Step 1** (`survey-step-1.tsx`): Motivation, goals, learner profile
- **Step 2** (`survey-step-2.tsx`): Prior knowledge, learning preferences
- **Step 3** (`survey-step-3.tsx`): Commitment, reminders, feedback

#### Loading Skeleton (`survey-skeleton.tsx`)
- **Placeholder UI** while data loads

### 5. Authentication Integration
- **Protected route** in middleware
- **Automatic redirect** for new users to survey
- **Survey completion check** in redirect logic

## Survey Questions Implemented

### Step 1: Motivation & Goals (4 questions)
1. **Primary Goal**: Daily conversation, heritage language, school curriculum, workplace need, travel, other
2. **Time Horizon**: <1 month, 1-3 months, 3-6 months, 6+ months
3. **Role**: Myself (adult), child (under 13), child (13-17), classroom/group
4. **Age Band**: 4-6, 7-9, 10-12, 13-17, 18-34, 35-54, 55+ years

### Step 2: Prior Knowledge & Preferences (4 questions)
1. **Mother Tongue**: Dropdown with common Indian languages
2. **Reading Level**: None, few vowels, most vowels & consonants, comfortable reader
3. **Exposure**: Daily, weekly, rarely, never
4. **Learning Formats**: Quick quizzes, story mode, trace letters, speaking practice, leaderboard (multi-select)
5. **Session Length**: 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 20+ min

### Step 3: Commitment & Feedback (4 questions)
1. **Calendar Opt-in**: Yes (with email + time preference), No thanks
2. **Notification Preferences**: Mobile push, email digest, WhatsApp, none (multi-select)
3. **Referral Source**: Friend/family, Instagram, YouTube, school, other
4. **Early Tester**: Yes please, maybe later

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Flow
1. **User signs up** → Redirected to survey
2. **Survey loads** → Fetches existing data (if any)
3. **Step completion** → Saves data incrementally
4. **Survey completion** → Redirects to learning dashboard

### Validation
- **Step-by-step validation** ensures required fields are filled
- **Conditional validation** (e.g., "other" text fields only required when "other" is selected)
- **Email validation** for calendar invites

### State Management
- **Local state** for form data in each step
- **Progress tracking** for step completion
- **Optimistic updates** with error handling

### UI/UX Features
- **Responsive design** with mobile-first approach
- **Progress indicator** showing completion percentage
- **Card-based layout** for visual organization
- **Hover effects** and interactive elements
- **Icons** for visual context (Lucide React)
- **Loading states** and skeleton screens

## Database Schema Details

```sql
-- Key tables and enums created:
- survey_responses table
- Multiple enums for structured data
- Step completion tracking fields
- Timestamps for audit trail
```

## Integration Points

### Authentication
- **Clerk integration** for user identification
- **Protected routes** via middleware
- **Automatic redirects** based on survey status

### Navigation
- **Post-signup flow** directs to survey
- **Survey completion** redirects to learning dashboard
- **Resume capability** for incomplete surveys

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Analytics integration** for survey response tracking
2. **A/B testing** for different survey flows
3. **Conditional questions** based on previous answers
4. **Survey response analysis** for personalization
5. **Email automation** for calendar invites
6. **WhatsApp integration** for notifications

### Personalization Opportunities
- **Course path recommendations** based on goals
- **Content difficulty** based on reading level
- **Reminder frequency** based on commitment level
- **UI adaptation** based on age group

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `db/schema/survey-schema.ts`
- `actions/db/survey-actions.ts`
- `types/survey-types.ts`
- `app/(auth)/survey/page.tsx`
- `app/(auth)/survey/_components/survey-container.tsx`
- `app/(auth)/survey/_components/survey-step-1.tsx`
- `app/(auth)/survey/_components/survey-step-2.tsx`
- `app/(auth)/survey/_components/survey-step-3.tsx`
- `app/(auth)/survey/_components/survey-skeleton.tsx`

### Modified Files
- `db/schema/index.ts` - Added survey schema export
- `db/db.ts` - Added survey table to schema
- `types/index.ts` - Added survey types export
- `middleware.ts` - Added survey route protection
- `components/auth/redirect-after-sign-in.tsx` - Added survey completion check

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. **Sign up** for the app
2. **Complete the 3-step survey** (takes ~3-5 minutes)
3. **Navigate between steps** using Back/Next buttons
4. **Resume later** if needed (progress is saved)
5. **Access learning content** after completion

### For Developers
1. **Database setup**: Run migrations to create survey tables
2. **Environment variables**: Ensure Clerk and database configs are set
3. **Testing**: Test the complete flow from signup to survey completion
4. **Customization**: Modify questions or add new steps as needed

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] User can access survey after signup
- [ ] Survey saves progress on each step
- [ ] Validation works for all required fields
- [ ] Conditional fields show/hide correctly
- [ ] Survey completion redirects properly
- [ ] Existing users can resume incomplete surveys
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness works
- [ ] Loading states display correctly
- [ ] Error handling works for network issues

This implementation provides a solid foundation for user onboarding and data collection while maintaining a smooth user experience and robust technical architecture.
