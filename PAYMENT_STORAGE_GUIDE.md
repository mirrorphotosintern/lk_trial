# Payment Storage Implementation Guide

## ✅ **Payment Details Storage in Supabase - FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

Your app now comprehensively stores **ALL payment details** in the Supabase `payments` table when payments are completed.

## 📊 **What's Stored in the Database**

### **Core Payment Fields:**
- **`id`**: Stripe session/payment intent ID (primary key)
- **`userId`**: User who made the payment
- **`credits`**: Number of credits purchased
- **`amountPaid`**: Amount paid in dollars
- **`currency`**: Payment currency (USD)
- **`email`**: Customer email address
- **`name`**: Customer name (if provided)
- **`status`**: Payment status (pending/completed/failed/refunded)

### **Stripe Integration Fields:**
- **`stripeSessionId`**: Stripe Checkout Session ID
- **`stripePaymentIntentId`**: Stripe Payment Intent ID  
- **`stripeCustomerId`**: Stripe Customer ID

### **Enhanced Metadata (JSON):**
```json
{
  "purchaseType": "credits",
  "paymentStatus": "paid",
  "customerEmail": "user@example.com",
  "customerName": "John Doe",
  "eventType": "checkout.session.completed",
  "objectId": "cs_xxxxx",
  "paymentMethod": ["card"],
  "billingDetails": {...},
  "checkoutMode": "payment",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "stripeEventType": "checkout.session.completed",
  "stripeDetails": {
    "sessionId": "cs_xxxxx",
    "paymentIntentId": "pi_xxxxx", 
    "customerId": "cus_xxxxx",
    "amount": 4.99,
    "currency": "usd"
  }
}
```

### **Timestamps:**
- **`createdAt`**: When payment was recorded
- **`updatedAt`**: Last update timestamp

## 🔄 **Payment Flow with Storage**

1. **User initiates payment** → Checkout session created
2. **User completes payment** → Stripe webhook fired
3. **Webhook processes payment** → Comprehensive details stored in Supabase
4. **Credits added to user** → User gets their credits
5. **Success page displays** → Shows payment confirmation with database details

## 🔍 **Monitoring & Debugging**

### **Webhook Logs**
Every payment generates detailed logs:

```
💳 Preparing to store comprehensive payment details: {
  objectId: "cs_xxxxx",
  userId: "user_xxxxx", 
  credits: 100,
  amountPaid: 4.99,
  currency: "usd",
  email: "user@example.com"
}

✅ Payment record successfully stored in Supabase: {
  paymentId: "cs_xxxxx",
  userId: "user_xxxxx",
  credits: 100,
  amount: "4.99",
  status: "completed",
  createdAt: "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z"
}

✅ Credits successfully added to user account: {
  userId: "user_xxxxx",
  creditsAdded: 100,
  newBalance: 250,
  paymentId: "cs_xxxxx"
}
```

### **Admin Monitoring**
Access payment data via API:
```
GET https://yourdomain.com/api/admin/payments?limit=20
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "count": 10,
  "payments": [...],
  "summary": {
    "totalCredits": 1500,
    "totalRevenue": 89.85,
    "completedPayments": 9
  }
}
```

## 📋 **Available Database Actions**

### **Core Functions:**
- `createPaymentAction()` - Store new payment
- `getUserPaymentsAction()` - Get user's payment history
- `getPaymentBySessionIdAction()` - Find payment by session ID
- `getUserTotalCreditsAction()` - Calculate user's total purchases
- `updatePaymentStatusAction()` - Update payment status

### **Usage Example:**
```typescript
// Get user's payment history
const result = await getUserPaymentsAction("user_123")
if (result.isSuccess) {
  console.log(`User has ${result.data.length} payments`)
  result.data.forEach(payment => {
    console.log(`${payment.credits} credits for $${payment.amountPaid}`)
  })
}

// Find specific payment
const payment = await getPaymentBySessionIdAction("cs_xxxxx")
if (payment.isSuccess && payment.data) {
  console.log(`Payment found: ${payment.data.credits} credits`)
}
```

## 🎯 **Success Page Integration**

The success page now shows:
- ✅ **Payment verification** from Stripe
- ✅ **Payment details** from your database
- ✅ **Current credit balance**
- ✅ **Transaction confirmation** 

## 🚨 **Error Handling & Recovery**

### **Comprehensive Error Logging:**
- Payment storage failures are logged with full details
- Critical errors when credits aren't added are flagged for manual review
- All payment processing is logged for audit trail

### **Failure Recovery:**
- If payment storage fails, credits are still added to prevent user loss
- All failures are logged with timestamp and details for manual resolution
- Payment processing continues even if database write fails

## 🧪 **Testing Payment Storage**

1. **Make a test purchase**
2. **Check deployment logs** for payment storage confirmation
3. **Visit success page** to see payment details displayed
4. **Access admin endpoint** to view payment in database
5. **Verify credit balance** matches payment

## 📊 **Database Schema**

The `payments` table includes:

```sql
CREATE TABLE payments (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,                    -- Stripe session/payment ID
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL,                 -- User who paid
  stripe_session_id TEXT NOT NULL,       -- Stripe session ID
  stripe_payment_intent_id TEXT,         -- Stripe payment intent ID  
  stripe_customer_id TEXT,               -- Stripe customer ID
  credits INTEGER NOT NULL,              -- Credits purchased
  amount_paid DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,    -- Amount paid
  currency TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'usd',  -- Payment currency

  name TEXT,                             -- Customer name
  status payment_status NOT NULL,        -- Payment status enum
